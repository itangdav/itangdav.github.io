### Sudoku Solver
<ol>
  <li><p style="font-weight:bold">Algorithmic Sudoku Solver in Java</p>
    
  This is a modular sudoku solver where you can easily add more algorithms and it attempts to solve the puzzle by using as many algorithmic steps as possible. Once it gets stuck, it will make an optimized guess before continuing with using algorithms and use backtracking if it encounters an unsolvable board. It also keeps track of the number of guesses which is a good approxiamation of the difficulty of a puzzle.

  Using the Tensorflow package in Python, I trained a convolutional neural network to solve Sudoku puzzles on more than a million distinct training cases. It only has a mid-80s percent testing accuracy after several weeks of training, which can be improved further with more training data. Yet, using a step-by-step interpretation of the data, I am able to get the solution for any input to be very close or exactly the solution.
